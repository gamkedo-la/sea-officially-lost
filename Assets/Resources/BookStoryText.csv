MainTextSummary,We believed that the jewelry box is in the wreck of the plane to the NW.  The wreck location will show up in the navigation system in our diving suits.  Watch out for the worms.  They are the precursor to an attack by a monster shark the likes of which you have probably never seen.  Find this box and throw it in the portal to close it.,,1,,
JournalEntryOne,The heart of the monster is sealed away in the box adorned with the ancient symbol.  This quote has been mentioned in multiple books but I haven't been able to figure out what it means.  What is the ancient symbol?  Where can I find this box?  This portal is getting bigger and I keep seeing this shark that is larger than anything that has been recorded before.  It will appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as fast.  Is it real?  I don't know anymore.,,1,,
JournalEntryTwo,I think I've found reference to what the ancient symbol is.  It's a pentagram.  Which makes sense I guess.  There are cliches for a reason and all myths have some type of origin.  This begs the question: where are we going to find a specific box with a pentagram on it deep underwater?  I would rather try and find a needle in a haystack.,,1,,
JournalEntryThree,"Akheilos.  The shark monster that we have been seeing has a name.  Monster doesn't do it justice.  It appears out of nowhere and disappears just as fast.  We've discovered a pattern to the appearances.  When those worm things swarm around someone and burst, it seems to do something to the space around the person.  If enough of them attack quickly enough the shark will appear and attack.  We only know this because Alice was able to hide in the wreck of a ship long enough for it to disappear again.",,1,,
JournalEntryFour,There is some hope!  Alice has remembered something from when she was hiding in the plane wreck.  She said that there appeared to be a glowing box with a pentagram on it.  She was freaked out from hiding from that monster and it didn't register with her until she was pouring over our notes again.  What are the chances that this is the box with the heart in it?  Do we have any other options than to try and make it to the wreck and get the box?  What do we do with it then?,,1,,
JournalEntryFive,"We lost another team member to Akheilos, while trying to get that cursed box.  There are only two of us left.  I'm not sure that we are going to be able to make it out of this situation alive.  What's worse is that we are starting to hear whispers when no one is around.  Is it the pleas of the dead asking for solace? Is it some other trick of this monster to make us doubt our sanity?  All I know is it's getting worse the more of us die.",,1,,
JournalEntrySix,"I've found another clue, although it was too late to help Alice.  I'm the last survivor.  From what I've read I have to throw the sealed heart of the beast into maw of the vortex to banish Akheilos from this plane.  So far no one has survived an attempted to get to the plane wreck and back with that box.  I have no other choice but to try again.",,1,,
JournalEntrySeven,"I can't believe that I'm here writing this.  I tried to make it to the wreck and was caught by those worm things and the shark appeared.  I couldn't get away and was sure I was dead.  I FELT its teeth as it bit through me.  That pain isn't something I made up.  Next think I know, I'm waking up in the base.  Alive.  Whole.  What's going on?",,1,,
JournalEntryEight,I tried to get to the plane wreck again.  I died.  Again.  I don't know why I'm not staying dead and I can't find anything in the books to explain it to me.  Is this a blessing or a curse?  I can't decide.  I do know I wish I had known this before the others died.  I could have kept them safe.,,1,,
JournalEntryNine,"I still haven't been able to succeed at getting to the wreck and back.  There has to be a way to do it, I just haven't found it yet.  I have confirmed that there is a box in the wreck though.  I've also noticed something else.  I'm losing my memories each time I die.  I was reading through old notes and found a reference to an Alice.  I don't remember any Alice or anyone else.",,1,,
